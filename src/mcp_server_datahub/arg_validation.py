"""Parameter types for list arguments that clients may send as a string.

MCP clients and LLMs frequently serialize a list-typed argument as a *string*: either a
JSON-encoded array (``'["a", "b"]'``) or a single bare value (``'a'``). Pydantic rejects
that against a plain ``List[str]`` before the tool body runs.

Widening the annotation to ``List[str] | str`` would accept it, but publishes
``anyOf: [array, string]``. Strict function-calling APIs reject a parameter with no
single declared type: Google Gemini (#98), and several OpenAI-compatible endpoints,
which reject the *whole* tool list with a 422 (#173). So:

- ``StrList`` (the default): coerce the string to a list in a ``BeforeValidator``. The
  schema stays a plain array and the tool body always receives a list.
- ``StrListOrStr``: only for tools whose body must see the original string (e.g.
  ``get_entities`` returns a single dict for a bare URN). The runtime type stays the
  union and ``WithJsonSchema`` publishes a plain array.

    Parsing is delegated to pydantic's own strict JSON parser: a string that parses to a
    JSON array is used as-is, anything else is treated as a single value. Item
    validation stays with the outer ``List[str]``, so this only decides list-vs-scalar.

    Malformed JSON is deliberately not repaired (unlike ``get_entities``, which uses
    ``repair_json``): most of these parameters feed write tools, where guessing at a
    broken array is riskier than treating the string as one literal value.

    ``""`` and ``"null"`` mean "no value", not a one-item list: they become ``None``, so
    an optional parameter is treated as omitted and a required one is still rejected.
    Otherwise ``column_paths="null"`` would tag a column literally named ``null``.
